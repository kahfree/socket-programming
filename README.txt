1. Download and extract the .zip file into a directory on your machine.
All files are named respective of which application they belong to (i.e. 'Client-1' is the client part of the first application).
2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory location of the scripts.
3. Run the server script (the './' convention will work, but if there are errors use the 'python3' command)
4. Open a new terminal window, and run the client script.
